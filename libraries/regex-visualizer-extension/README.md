# Regex Visualizer / Debugger

This extension allows you to debug your regular expressions directly from vscode.

### supports 
- **ECMAScript (JavaScript) regular expressions only**
- Basic syntax (groups, options, escaped characters, any character, list etc.)
- Separate webview to display regex and matched string
- real time regex parsing / matching
- async calls to match string for non-blocking webview
- hover on regular expression in your editor + link to that expression in visualization

## About

You should have basic knowledge about the regular expressions, but this extension can certainly help you understand regular expressions and how they handle matching strings. The visualization works by highlighting position in regular expression and in matching string, there are also displayed backtracking (state in regular expression from which no other path is possible).

## Future

This extension has many limitations, and isn't finished product, but there are plans for the future, updating this plugin.
